## Morning
I continued working on the recapi story. Just a little progress as we wait for
the other team to make up their minds about what exactly the recapi will do.

## Standup
I finished my i18n bugs and received some more i18n bugs.

## Afterwords
Not much happened during the rest of the day. I continued to work on the recapi
story, but it was just little things like making sure the JSON was parsed correctly.

### What I learned
+ Certain translation teams are more prompt than others

### What I still need to learn
+ What the recapi team wants the recapi to do

### What I wish I had already learned
+ How to take advantage of our internationalization library to track other variables
