## Morning
I started working on how to remove the wildcards from my code and still have it 
function properly. I have a good idea that should work, but it will take some 
time after Standup.

## Standup
During Standup I expressed my thoughts on how to fix the wildcard solution and 
I got the approval to go ahead with it.

## Afterwords
I have the search working without wildcards now and I am working on only having 
the search box show when English countries are selected.

### What I learned
+ Github is amazing, and lets you see exactly what files a coworker has modified with a recent push

### What I still need to learn
+ A good way to allow differing countries to be searched against

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Nothing comes to mind for today
