## Morning
We finally were assigned teams to work on, and I was assigned to the Search Team 
inside of FamilySearch. Kind of confusing name, but my team is in charge of finding 
names from all the records that the church has access too.

## Tech Talk
We met together with all the developers of FamilySearch and someone in Salt Lake 
City presented on a conference that they had attended.

## Frontier Training
The three managers took all of us interns into a room and we worked through the 
Frontier webstack. The technologies that they use include Node, Express, EJS, Github, 
and Strong. EJS is a templating language, and Strong is used for translation. This 
training took up the rest of the day.

### What I learned
+ I couldn't have ended up in an internship that used any more relevant technologies than FamilySearch

### What I still need to learn
+ Node and Express

### What I wish I had already learned
+ EJS or another templating engine like Mustache
