## Morning
I spent most of this morning playing with expect.js to get it to load into our 
Mocha tests. I hadn't figured it out by the time standup came around.

## Standup
Today's standup was very informal. The product manager was in Salt Lake City for 
a different meeting and two of the developers were working from home in the morning,
so it took about two minutes just to explain what the other devleoper and I had 
done yesterday.

## Team Meeting
Because of the devotional yesterday, the chairs were all aranged towards the front, 
so we only moved one table towords the camera so that the team in Salt Lake City 
could see the speaker. None of the microphones were set up either, so we had one 
microphone that we passed around as the 'conch shell' to help facilitate the 
discussion. I introduced myself this week to all of the teams.

## Lunch
I quickly passed off my responsive website design to my manager and so those who 
have been working on the Web Developer Skills program were taken to lunch. We went 
to Pizza Pie Cafe and had a good time bonding with the other developers.

## Afterwords
I finally got expect.js to load in the tests, and all 10 of my tests now use expect 
instead of Chai. I'll be able to finish this story tomorrow at Standup.

### What I learned
+ I was making the expect.js problem too difficult. I should have tried some simple tests first

### What I still need to learn
+ How to get Frontier to work with custom themes

### What I wish I had already learned
+ The method of including expect.js in our tests
