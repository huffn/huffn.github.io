## Morning
We're not supposed to push any changes later today, so we were all in early making 
sure that any stories that we wanted to have tested were out before noon.

## Standup
There wasn't anything in particular that I presented for this Standup. I had been 
working on the tests and I am now finished with one of the larger functions of the 
search utility file we use. There are 10 tests that make sure that data gets 
converted into a lucene query and back into an associative array.

## Afterwords
Today I spent some time working on my Skills Development site because we can't 
push any new code. So I worked on getting AnglarJS working on my Heroku site. I 
decided for a handwritten theme, and so I have Angular running as a task manager. 
With my own handwriting. It should provide a little flavor for my portfolio site.
