## Morning
We left early from Orem to make sure we got to the Salt Lake Public Library in time 
for the conference.

## Conference
This conference was the best way that all of FamilySearch's developers could learn 
more about AngularJS. There were several previous church employees that presented, 
and some of the best presentations were the ones that provided hands on examples 
by providing github repositories with branches for each state of their presentations.
That way we could follow along with his files and stay up-to-date if we were typing 
along.

### What I learned
+ AngularJS is a really good platform for building javascript apps

### What I still need to learn
+ How to include AngularJS into my javascript apps

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Backbone.js is not the direction that BYU-Idaho should be thinking about for I-Learn
