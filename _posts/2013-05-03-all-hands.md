## Morning
I drove into Salt Lake City with some of the other interns. We ended up getting 
their really early, which is just fine.

## All Hands Meeting
There was a big push by the FamilySearch team to get a release of FamilySearch out 
by the middle of April. There is an entirely new look and feel, as well as new 
functionality. Lots of statistics were shared about how more people are using 
FamilySearch since the new release. It looks like I showed up just in time for 
things to get really interesting.

## Classes
After the large group meeting, there were several classes that were offered, kind 
of like a mini genealogy conference. I attended some really cool classes that 
helped me get up to date with what things have changed in the new version of 
FamilySearch.
