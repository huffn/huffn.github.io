## Morning
Today I kept working on the datastaging story. I guess it has a new name now: Records
API, or recapi for short.

## Standup
I was assigned several i18n stories. They shouldn't take too long to work out.

## Afterwords
The hardest thing I tried to do today was rebase the master branch onto my working
branch in GitHub to pick up some of the changes that other people had committed.
Oh my goodness, that was way more complicated and stress inducing that I thought
it would be.
