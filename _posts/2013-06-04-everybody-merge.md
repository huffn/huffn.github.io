## Morning
I continued working on the datastaging story today. Nothing real exciting happened
other than I think I might have tracked down where a proxy was tweaking what I
thought was already fixed. But not a lot will get passed off today because we have
sell-offs later today.

## Sell-off
The csv story is going off for some testing by some Family History centers to find
out if the information being returned is useful. The datastaging story will extend
to the next iteration because we're not exactly sure what the other team really
wants. Whether we actually put more time into the story is a different question.

### What I learned
+ Sell-off days are most productive in the morning before sell-offs

### What I still need to learn
+ Where the line is drawn for a design that has too much information

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Nothing in particular for today
