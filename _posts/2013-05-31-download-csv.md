## Morning
I started working on a story to allow users to download their search results as a
csv file. In the morning I dealt with emailing the owners of the database that we
would be querying to get the csv file from.

## Standup
I shared my progress with the csv story, but nothing else really happened.

## Afterwords
I added some more of the features that were needed for the csv story. Now users
have to be logged in to see the download link, I added the route in the node app
so that the download could be initiated. And started working on the pagination
of results would return a different csv file.

### What I learned
+ Making new features can be more engaging than fixing bugs

### What I still need to learn
+ What the offset and count variables are for the server

### What I wish I had already learned
+ How to name generated files and how to trigger the download as dialog box
