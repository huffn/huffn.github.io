## Morning
This morning wasn't much different from any other day. I showed up around 8:30 and 
got to work fixing the 1940 census result page that I was assigned to test. The 
component that I was working on, didn't match the styling of the other search forms 
so I spent some time reformatting the html to match the other forms while not changing 
how the CSS reacted to my changes.

## Standup
I reported that I got expect.js to work for our client side tests. And I was 
assigned some Internationalization bugs to work on.

## Lunch
Today we had a team lunch. Since I still don't know what restraunts are in the 
area, I didn't provide feedback on where we should eat. We ended up eating at a 
restraunt called Wallabys Smokehouse in Lindon. It kind of reminded me of Rudy's 
BBQ in Texas. I ended up eating the daily special which was a 1/3 Rack of Ribs and 
I wasn't disappointed. It was delicious.

## Afterwords
Since it is Friday, we can't push any changes in the afternoon, just so we can be 
sure to catch any bugs before the weekend starts. And this weekend is a longer 
weekend so we don't want to cause any more problems for the on call developer. 
Luckily, my hours were up for the week, so I was just able to update the information 
on my bug reports and call it a day.
