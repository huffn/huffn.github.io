## Morning
Today I think I finished up the last little bits of the datastaging story. One of
my coworkers thinks there is a lot more to it, but I haven't run into anything yet.

## Standup
In Standup I was assigned some more translation bugs as well as an issue where in
other languages, an error box wouldn't expand to hold all of its text.

## Afterwords
No team meeting today, so I just continued working on the datastaging story as well
as played with the site in other languages to find out what the best solution will
be to make sure the error messages all fit in their boxes.
