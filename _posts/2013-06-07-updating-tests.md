## Morning
In the morning I worked a little on my skills app. And then read through some of
the pull requests that had come in from the other teams. It looks like they have
made up their minds about the testing framework.

## Standup

## Afterwords
It looks like the standard for writing tests is now going to use Chai again. Luckily
that is what I first started writing our client-side tests in. We did switch from
using assert to expect, but the language isn't that much different.
