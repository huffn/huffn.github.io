## Morning
When I got to work today I jumped into finishing up my translation bugs because 
this was the end of the first sprint, while I have been here at FamilySearch.

## Sell-offs
This was a smaller sell-off than usual because I came on halfway through the sprint, 
and there was only one developer working during the full shift. The planning meeting 
was much longer because now there are four developers to assign stories to. I got 
some more translation stories, as well as some testing stories that I can work on 
now.

## Afterwords
There wasn't too much that happend after sell-offs. We just got straight to work 
on our stories. I'll get the testing stuff figured out soon.

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Any testing procedures for javascript
