## Morning
Today I spent the morning working on figuring out how the localization library 
Strong inserts the correct strings where they belong.

## Standup
This Standup meeting was focused on what we learned at the All Hands meeting. I 
also met the other two members of the Search team. One had been at a conference, 
and the other had been on a different team for the past two weeks. It looks like 
I got the best team in all of FamilySearch!

## One on One
I met with my manager today and we talked about the Web Development Skills program. 
It looks like a cool way to keep everyone up-to-date with their knowledge of web 
technologies. This looks like an easy way for me to get up to speed with the 
Frontier webstack.

### What I still need to learn

### What I wish I had already learned
