## Morning
We started today off with a Standup meeting. I was mistaken as one of the developers 
children by the program manager because I just have one of those faces, I guess. 
But I was introduced to the team officially. I was given some bugs to work on as 
my first stories, because that is the best way to get acquainted with the system.

## Shadows
The rest of the day was spent watching the other developer work so I could figure 
out a good workflow that worked for me.

### What I learned
+ I'm glad I purchased both Sublime Text 2 and WebStorm. Both tools are used here at FamilySearch

### What I still need to learn
+ The daily routine

### What I wish I had already learned
+ The routing system that Node and Express use
