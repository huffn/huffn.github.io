## Morning
This morning I spent some time working on alternate datastaging URL. It should be
really close for testing. I just have to make sure that all links that it catches,
it can translate correctly into their correct datastaging URLs.

## Standup
For Standup I was assigned a couple more translation errors. It seems like all the
Russian translations errors are coming in now. They shouldn't be too hard to fix
as long as I can reproduce the errors myself, so I can test the fixes out.

## Afterwords
A lot of people are gone this week for a conference down in California, so it is
pretty quite here. It should get back to normal this coming Monday. We've been
cancelling some of our weekly events just because attendance would have been so
low. As for my afternoon. I finished working on an alternate reporter for our
Karma tests so that we have a more verbose report once the tests have run.
