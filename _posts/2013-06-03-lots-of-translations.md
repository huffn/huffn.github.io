## Morning
Today I went back to working on the datastaging story. There always seems to be
just a little more that has to be tweaked. I guess this is what happens when your
scope begins to creep.

## Standup
I received a lot of stories to fix some translations, so I know what I'll be working
on this afternoon.

## Afterwords
I updated some alt text for my csv story and then updated a lot of translations for
the 1940 census page in every language except English (since we already had those
strings translated).

### What I learned
+ Working on a different teams pet project is just asking for scope creep

### What I still need to learn
+ How Strong is able to translated based on locales

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Eating the same food for lunch for two months gets pretty stale
