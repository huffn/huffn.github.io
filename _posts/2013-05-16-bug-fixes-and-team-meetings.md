## Morning
I think I came up with a solution that will check if the page is in English.

## Standup
It looks like the fix I had for checking if the user was using an English browser 
needed some additional checks. We were getting some errors where locale wasn't 
defined. So I was assigned to fix that bug.

## Team Meeting
We were prepped on the conference for tomorrow. It looks like it will be an exciting 
conference. I'm glad that the church is letting me go.

## Afterwords
I fixed some small issues where the dropdown list for the secondary jurisdiction 
would pop down in a different lanugage even though there wasn't a box for it to 
drop down next to.

### What I still need to learn
+ A good method of testing undefined variables

### What I wish I had already learned
+ How to use OR statements to test for undefined variables
