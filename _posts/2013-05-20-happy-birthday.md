## Morning
Today was my birthday, so Jenna made me some biscuits with sausage and gravy. It 
was delicious! At work, I spent some time getting some Russian translations included 
in our internationalization files.

## Standup
We covered some of our favorite parts of the conference as well as what happend 
for the outage that was experienced by several chrome users on Thursday.

## Afterwords
I'm not sure if I made any progress on the expect.js loading in our tests, but I 
tried several ways that didn't work.

### What I learned
+ Dependency injection is great if you don't use up all the local storage space

### What I still need to learn
+ Why expect.js is refusing to load using require.js

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Which javascript assertion library is the best for FamilySearch
