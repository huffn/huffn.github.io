## Morning
Today I started working on fixing some CSS errors that were introduced from the 
new theme that was introduced in the middle of April. The css for these pages is 
written in Stylus, so I had to read up a little on the syntax that Stylus uses.

## Standup
I almost have the CSS fixed, and I said that in Standup. It should be ready within 
an hour.

## One on One
We discussed the Skills Development site and I made some goals on how to get further 
on on the development program.

## Afterwords
Error messages now show up styled correctly in our app. The function declaration 
was after all the CSS that used that function, so it returned undefined. Makes 
perfect sense once you understand that is what Stylus was doing.

### What I learned
+ Stylus has some cool mixins functionality that works well when you follow the rules

### What I still need to learn
+ More Stylus

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Compass or SASS those seem to be the big alternative CSS languages
