## Morning
Since yesterday was Sell-offs, there were all sorts of tasks that I was able to 
pick from to work on today. I ended up chosing to work on including the secondary 
jurisdiction when searching for English speaking countries.

## Standup
Not too much happened in this Standup meeting. I reported that I am still working 
on getting expect.js to work with our tests.

## Afterwords
I finished getting the secondary jurisdiction fields working and started testing 
the 1940 census specific page.

### What I learned
+ Manual tests are tedious. If there is a way to automate the tests, take advantage of it

### What I still need to learn
+ How to get expect.js to work with our tests

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Nothing specific for today
