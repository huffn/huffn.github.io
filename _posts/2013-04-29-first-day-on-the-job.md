## Early Traffic
Jenna and I spent the last week unpacking our stuff and getting settled into our
new apartment. So today I woke up extra early, because I had no idea what traffic
would be like on my way to Salt Lake City. Orientation started at 8:30 in the
morning, so I left Orem at 6. Traffic was non-existent and I made it to Salt Lake
by 7, and parked my car underneath the Conference Center. I then walked to the
Church Office Building and asked the security guard where I should wait until the
doors opened at 8:30 at the Human Resource department.

## Orientation
There were over 25 of us scheduled for the orientation meeting this morning. I
guess everybody wanted to start their internships before May 1st. There are three
of us interning at FamilySearch in Orem for the frontend development group. And
there were some issues with some of the other's paperwork. The man at the front
desk said that not all the right emails were sent last week. I was able to get
through easily enough and I received a security badge for the Church Office
Building. After all the paperwork was taken care of, we had a group meeting where
we walked through all of the paperwork that we needed to fill out to make sure we
are legal and financially set up.

## Back in Orem
Orientation didn't take very long and by 11, we were all headed back to Orem to
become acquainted with the frontend development group. All of us interns were
given the whirlwind tour of the facilities as we met with several of the teams
who work on the first floor of 'Building S'. We were then treated to lunch at
Costa Vida and then we came back to get our workstations all set up. FamilySearch
is letting each of us use a 27" Cinema Display screen with a MacBook Pro. I know
that everyone (especially Clay) in the I-Learn Developers Group wished they had
this kind of set up. After we were mostly set up, we were finished for the day.
We didn't all have our teams figured out, so we'll find out more tomorrow.

### What I learned
+ Traffic doesn't have to be so bad as long as you plan ahead for it
+ Family history is taken very seriously by the church
+ FamilySearch uses an AGILE development cycle

### What I still need to learn
+ FamilySearch's software stack called Frontier
+ Everyone's names

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Markdown as a markup language, because I am writing these blog posts with markdown
+ More practice with node.js because FamilySearch relies heavily on node
