## Morning
Now that the secondary jurisdiction form works like it is supposed to. I was
assigned to test it, since we don't have a dedicated tester on our team. I was
given a run book, that lists out lots of test cases that I should test the
secondary jurisdiction against.

## Standup
I started the tests and plan on completing them this afternoon. No new stories
were assigned to me.

## Afterwords
I didn't discover any bugs with the secondary jurisdiction form, but while running
through the tests, I noticed that one of the search forms had some other bugs. So
I got to report them and a coworker had a fix for them quite quickly.

+ Testing is vital for the healthiness of your system

### What I still need to learn
+ To write code to pass tests instead of writing tests after code has been written

### What I wish I had already learned
+ How to automate testing with karma or mocha
