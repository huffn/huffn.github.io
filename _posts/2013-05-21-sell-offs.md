## Morning
Today is Sell-offs, so our goal was to get as much done on our remaining stories 
before we present them to our program manager.

## Sell-offs
This meeting was extra long since we bundled Sell-offs with our Planning meeting 
to get ready for this next sprint. This is the second sprint that I'm included in 
and so there are more stories that have been assigned to me.

## Devotional
Elder Richard G. Scott spoke to the Family History Department today from Salt Lake 
City. We watched it downstairs in our meeting room. It was a good meeting. Elder 
Scott shared several stories about family history and encouraged us all to continue 
doing family history so that we could have temple experiences.

## Afterwords
I spent the afternoon working on the secondary jurisdiction search fields for the 
main search page.

### What I learned
+ Working for the church gives us lots of opportunities to hear from our leaders

### What I still need to learn
+ How the controllers work with specific partial views

### What I wish I had already learned
+ It takes at least two frozen burritos are required to recover from long meetings
