## Morning
There was a bug that was introduced with my secondary jurisdiction fix that a
corworker found. It worked just fine on the main search page, but on the refine
search page it wasn't showing up. So I spent this morning working on getting it
to show up without changing how it worked on the main search page.

## Standup
I reported my progress on fixing this bug, but nothing else really was mentioned.

## Afterwords
I have a pull request waiting that has a fix for the secondary jurisdiction. It
ended up being a day project since there was a lot of refactoring of some child
pages that took a lot more time than I thought.

### What I learned
+ It is really easy to over-promise something

### What I still need to learn
+ Don't over-promise things

### What I wish I had already learned
+ New features should be tested in a much through manner than little fixes
