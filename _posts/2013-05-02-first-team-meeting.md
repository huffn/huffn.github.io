## Morning
I came in early today and worked on my two bugs. I'm still figuring out a good 
workflow.

## Standup
The Program Manager attended today, so I was introduced to him. We reported what 
we had worked on since the last Standup meeting and that was about it.

## One on One
I met with my manager today for my first official one on one meeting. We discussed 
what my goals are while I am here at FamilySearch as well as what goals he had for
me. I'm excited to see what happens!

## Team Meeting
This is the first team meeting that I have gone to. There are four tables set up 
in the middle of the room and there is a camera that records what goes on at that 
table. There are several microphones around the table and pick up everything that 
is said. People sit at this table, and the ones who show up a little later, end up 
sitting around the table out of view of the camera. There is a FamilySearch team 
that works in Salt Lake City, so we teleconference with them for all team meetings. 
Today we listened to two people who had attended the same conference as the person 
from Tuesdays meeting.
