## Morning
I submitted my changes for the secondary jurisdiction into a pull request. I think
I fixed all the issues that had been identified.

## Standup
It looks like a lot of the translations teams are back from their vacations. I
received a lot of translation fixes.

## Afterwords
I spent the rest of the day finding where these strings were supposed to be stored
and then creating pull requests with the changed files.

### What I learned
+ Small changes in the phrasing of a sentence can drastically alter its meaning

### What I still need to learn
+ How to make sure that I write good tests to make sure my code is good

### What I wish I had already learned
+ Some japaneese, because it is really hard to make sure I am actually fixing these translations
