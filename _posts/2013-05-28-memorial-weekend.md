## Morning
Phew, I was worried that the long weekend would bring a lot of bugs onto our table
because we wouldn't be there each day to restart the server if there were issues.
There were some hiccups, but we are still going strong! This morning, I worked on
getting an experiment working to allow for an alternate datastaging URL.

## Standup
I presented my work at Standup, and it looks like we are in good shape to finish
this sprint with most of our stories accomplished.

## Afterwords
I continued to work on the alternate datastaging URL experiment. We were having
some issues with some of the files that I was working with, so I haven't pushed
anything yet. Maybe tomorrow we will start testing my tweaks.

### What I still need to learn

### What I wish I had already learned
+ E2E testing
